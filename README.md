# Welcome to IdleBot
IdleBot is a customizable incremental game played using a discord bot.

# Installation
Installation is super easy thanks to npm

1. Install Node.js as well as npm. https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Clone or download this repo
3. Navigate to the root directory of this repo
4. Execute `npm install`

# Configuration
Now that you have it installed, navigate to the config directory and rename example.config.ini to just config.ini.

Open that file in ~~vim~~ your favorite text editor and adjust the values to your liking. Make sure you add your secret token into the token line. (Ill potentially implement user and pass later)

Once you have finished configuring, save the file and run `node app` from the root dir to launch the bot!
